About
=====
A regular old blackjack game from the dawn of the interactive internet. Click
on how much you want to bet, click on "deal", try and beat the dealer.

The source code for this game was first developed in 1996, making it around 16
years old. It may or may not work on your particular JVM. I have managed to get
it to run just fine in Chrome 22, Firefox 15 and Internet Explorer 9.
